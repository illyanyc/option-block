# google-finance

The library handles fetching, parsing, and cleaning of CSV data and returns JSON result that is convenient and easy to work with. Both callback (last parameter) and promises (using [Bluebird](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird)) styles are supported.

### Specifying request options

Optionally request options (such as a proxy) can be specified by inserting an
extra parameter just before the callback:


```js
var httpRequestOptions = {
  proxy: 'http://localproxy.com'
};

googleFinance.companyNews({
  symbol: SYMBOL
}, httpRequestOptions, function (err, news) {
  // Result
});

googleFinance.historical({
  symbol: SYMBOL,
  from: START_DATE,
  to: END_DATE
}, httpRequestOptions, function (err, quotes) {
  // Result
});
```
